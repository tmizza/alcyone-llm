# **📌 Core Concepts of Large Language Models (LLMs)**  

### **🧠 What Is an LLM?**
- A **neural network** trained on large text data to generate text, complete prompts, and perform language tasks.
- Uses **transformer architecture**, which enables parallel processing and long-range context understanding.
- Based on **self-attention mechanisms** that dynamically weigh word relationships.

# **📌 Core Transformer Parameters & Hyperparameters**
| **Parameter** | **Definition** | **Typical Values** |
|--------------|---------------|--------------------|
| **VOCAB_SIZE** | Number of unique tokens in the model's vocabulary. | `20K - 100K` |
| **D_MODEL** | Dimensionality of token embeddings & hidden layers. | `512 - 4096` |
| **N_LAYERS** | Number of stacked transformer layers. | `6 - 96` |
| **N_HEADS** | Number of self-attention heads per layer. | `8 - 32` |
| **D_FF** | Size of feedforward network inside each layer (`4 * D_MODEL`). | `2048 - 16K` |
| **MAX_LEN** | Maximum token sequence length the model can handle. | `256 - 4096` |
| **BATCH_SIZE** | Number of sequences processed per training step. | `16 - 512` |
| **LR (Learning Rate)** | Controls weight adjustments during training. | `1e-3 - 5e-5` |
| **NUM_EPOCHS** | Number of complete training cycles over the dataset. | `10 - 100` |
| **SAVE_INTERVAL** | How often model checkpoints are saved. | Every `5` epochs |

# **📌 Key Components of a Transformer Model**
| **Component** | **Purpose** | **Key Equations** |
|--------------|------------|------------------|
| **Token Embeddings** | Converts token IDs into dense numerical vectors. | `X_input = Token_IDs × Embedding Matrix` |
| **Positional Encoding** | Adds order information to token embeddings. | `PE(pos, 2i) = sin(pos / 10000^(2i/D_MODEL))` |
| **Self-Attention** | Determines how words influence each other. | `Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QK^T / sqrt(D_MODEL)) V` |
| **Multi-Head Attention** | Allows the model to process different contextual relationships in parallel. | `Concat(head_1, head_2, ..., head_N) × W_O` |
| **Feedforward Network (FFN)** | Applies additional transformations to each token. | `FFN(X) = ReLU(XW_1 + b_1) W_2 + b_2` |
| **Layer Normalization** | Stabilizes activations across layers. | `X_normalized = (X - mean) / std_dev` |
| **Final Projection Layer** | Maps final hidden states back to vocabulary for token prediction. | `Logits = X × W_vocab` |

# **📌 LLM Training & Inference Workflow**
### **🛠️ Training Process**
1️⃣ **Tokenization**: Converts raw text into token IDs.  
2️⃣ **Embedding Lookup**: Maps token IDs to dense vectors.  
3️⃣ **Self-Attention**: Updates tokens based on contextual relationships.  
4️⃣ **Multi-Layer Processing**: Tokens pass through multiple layers.  
5️⃣ **Final Prediction**: Outputs logits, applies softmax to determine next token.  
6️⃣ **Loss Calculation**: Compares predictions to actual text, updates weights.  
7️⃣ **Gradient Descent**: Adjusts model weights using `loss.backward()`.  
8️⃣ **Repeat**: Process repeats until the model is fully trained.  

### **🛠️ Inference (Text Generation)**
1️⃣ **Input Text**: Tokenized & passed to model.  
2️⃣ **Model Processes Tokens**: Runs self-attention & transformations.  
3️⃣ **Softmax Applied**: Converts logits to probabilities.  
4️⃣ **Next Token Selected**: Based on highest probability or sampling techniques.  
5️⃣ **Loop Until Stop Condition**: Continues generating until `max_length` or stop token (`</s>`) is reached.

# **📌 Sampling Strategies for Better Generation**
| **Sampling Method** | **How It Works** | **When to Use** |
|--------------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Greedy Decoding** | Always picks the highest probability token. | Simple tasks, but repetitive outputs. |
| **Top-k Sampling** | Limits sampling to `k` highest probability tokens. | More diversity, but controlled randomness. |
| **Top-p (Nucleus) Sampling** | Picks tokens from a probability mass threshold (e.g., top `95%`). | Produces coherent, controlled outputs. |
| **Temperature Scaling** | Adjusts probability distribution (`T=0.7` → more focused, `T=1.5` → more random). | Increases/decreases creativity. |

# **📌 Debugging & Optimizing Training**
| **Issue** | **Cause** | **Fix** |
|----------|----------|--------|
| **CUDA Out of Memory (OOM)** | Batch size too high, model too large. | Reduce `BATCH_SIZE`, enable `torch.cuda.empty_cache()`. |
| **Diverging Loss (Loss Explodes)** | Learning rate too high. | Reduce `LR`, use learning rate decay. |
| **Slow Training** | Too many layers, inefficient hardware. | Use `fp16` (mixed precision), enable `gradient_checkpointing()`. |
| **Overfitting** | Too few training samples. | Increase dataset, add dropout regularization. |

# **📌 Experimentation Ideas**
### **🛠️ Customization Ideas for Your LLM**
- **Train on Custom Data**: Use domain-specific datasets (e.g., legal, medical, finance).  
- **Adjust Model Depth**: Experiment with `N_LAYERS` (shallow models learn quickly, deep ones generalize better).  
- **Expand Context Length**: Increase `MAX_LEN` for long-form text generation.  
- **Optimize Sampling**: Test different `top-k`, `top-p`, and `temperature` settings.  
- **Fine-Tune on Pretrained Models**: Instead of training from scratch, adapt an existing model to your dataset.
